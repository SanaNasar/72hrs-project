=============

Project in 72(ish) hours

*"Start with something small*"

In the spirit of Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days, I made small projects in 72hours. First, I started off with small steps and made a revist to my first project and added some more features to it.
This project was a motivation to experiment with a new technology and hone my front-end skills.

## Three things learnt
* HTML5 canvas 
* CSS3 transitions
* CSS3 animations

## For tutorials
