## Cody Adventure Camp
PS: *Cody* is my dog's name.

## Overview
The idea is to have some thumbnails that are clickable, and once clicked, the respective large image is shown. Using CSS transitions and animations, we can make the large image appear in a fancy way.
With the help of the pseudo-class *:target*, we will be able to show the lightbox images and navigate through them.

## Purpose
This is a project which has a collection of photos of my dog and created to capture all his special moments.
